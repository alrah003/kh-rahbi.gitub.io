## Description

During my professional experience, I had the opportunity to work on various projects and training coordination initiatives. I actively contributed to the development and execution of vocational training, museum curating management, and mentorship programs. Additionally, I played a key role in the coordination and organization of GUtech's SAP Dual Study Program, a prestigious program that involved recruiting and guiding a group of over 30 students.

### Collaborating with Marketing Managers

- **Project Outlines and Proposals**: I collaborated closely with marketing managers to develop comprehensive project outlines and proposals. These projects encompassed vocational training, museum curating management, and mentorship initiatives. By working together, we ensured the successful planning and implementation of these programs.

### GUtech's SAP Dual Study Program

- **Recruitment and Guidance**: I took charge of coordinating the SAP Dual Study Program at GUtech. This involved recruiting over 30 students for the program and guiding them through the entire process. From conducting interviews and selection procedures to organizing training and study sessions, I provided support and guidance to the participating students.

### Training Program Support

- **Planning and Preparation**: As a support to senior consultants, I assisted in planning, preparing, and executing training programs. One notable example was the Siemens Mechatronics Laboratory training program. I played a vital role in ensuring the smooth execution of the program by coordinating logistics, scheduling sessions, and providing necessary resources.

Through these experiences, I developed strong project management and coordination skills. I honed my ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, ensuring the successful execution of various programs. Moreover, my involvement in the recruitment and guidance of students showcased my passion for mentorship and supporting individuals in their educational journey.

Overall, my professional experience in project management and training coordination demonstrates my ability to drive initiatives, collaborate with stakeholders, and contribute to the success of educational and vocational programs. I look forward to leveraging this experience and expertise in future endeavors.
