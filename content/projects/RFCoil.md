## Description

During my work at the Magnetic Resonance Research Center (CMRR), I was involved in the development of a **phased-array receiver-transmitter head coil** for a **10.5 Tesla MRI** system. This project aimed to enhance imaging capabilities and advance research in the field of **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**.

### Key Highlights:

- Designed and tested a **Transmit/Receive (T/R) switch circuit** specifically for the RF head coils. The circuit was successfully implemented and demonstrated a switching speed faster than **1Î¼s**, making it suitable for **Ultra-Short TE sequences**.
- Assisted in the building, testing, and detuning of the **phased-array head coil**, ensuring its optimal performance for high-resolution imaging at **10.5 Tesla**.
- Played a role in designing a **Low Noise Amplifier**, analyzing voltage and impedance data to compare experimental results with simulation outcomes. This analysis helped validate the performance of the amplifier in practical scenarios.

This project allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in **RF coil design**, **circuitry**, and **system optimization** within the field of **MRI**. It also provided opportunities to collaborate with a team of experts and contribute to cutting-edge research in high-field MRI technology.
