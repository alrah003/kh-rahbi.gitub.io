## Description

During my work at the Magnetic Resonance Research Center (CMRR), I conducted research and contributed to two significant projects related to RF head coils and passive RF field probes.

### Conducted Research on RF Head Coil Fuses:

- Analyzed and tested commonly used fuses for RF head coils, focusing on their performance and suitability.
- Developed new RF coil loop structures that resulted in a high-quality factor when the RF fuse is placed.
- Explored innovative techniques to optimize the RF fuse design and enhance overall coil performance.

### Building Passive High-Performance RF Field Probes:

- Designed and built passive RF field probes capable of achieving a very wide frequency range, up to 447MHz.
- Ensured the probes delivered accurate and reliable measurements of RF fields in various applications.
- Implemented advanced techniques to enhance the performance and sensitivity of the RF field probes.

These projects allowed me to apply my expertise in RF technology, circuit design, and experimental research. Through my contributions, I made significant advancements in RF head coil designs and the development of high-performance RF field probes. These experiences have strengthened my understanding of RF systems and their applications in the field of magnetic resonance research.
